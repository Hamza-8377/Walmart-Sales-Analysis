🛒 Walmart Sales Analysis
📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes Walmart sales data to uncover key business insights.
I worked on it as a beginner data analyst project to practice data cleaning, SQL queries, Python analysis, and dashboard creation.

The dataset contains weekly sales information for different Walmart stores. The goal was to clean the data, analyze sales trends, and visualize results across tools.

🗂️ Project Files

Walmart file for db.csv → Raw dataset (used for SQL & Python)

Walmart_sales.xlsx → Excel file

.ipynb → Jupyter Notebook (NumPy & Pandas analysis)

MySQL script.sql → SQL queries for sales analysis


🔧 Tools & Technologies

Excel → Data cleaning, pivot tables, dashboard creation

MySQL → Database storage, queries, aggregations

Python (NumPy, Pandas, Jupyter Notebook) → Data cleaning & analysis

GitHub → Version control & project sharing

📊 Analysis Performed

Excel

Cleaned raw data and built an interactive dashboard

Visualized monthly sales, top-performing stores, holiday vs non-holiday weeks

SQL (MySQL)

Imported cleaned CSV into MySQL database

Wrote queries to analyze:

Holiday sales impact

Store-level sales ranking

Average weekly sales

Python (NumPy & Pandas)

Loaded and cleaned dataset in Jupyter Notebook

Grouped data by month/week for trend analysis


📈 Key Insights

Identified seasonal sales patterns (higher during holiday weeks).

Found the top-performing stores contributing most to revenue.

Monthly trends showed fluctuations influenced by holidays and events.

🚀 How to Use

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/Hamza-8377/Walmart-Sales-Analysis.git


Open the files:

.csv in excel

.xlsx in Excel

.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook

.sql in MySQL Workbench

📌 Status

This is my beginner data analysis project.
I plan to extend it later with Power BI dashboards and advanced Python visualizations (Matplotlib/Seaborn).

👏 Feedback is welcome! This is my first end-to-end project combining multiple tools.
